# Mech-craft_B
A proper repository for a mech building project

Mech and robot building games are fairly complex, and involve either voxel-based building, or prefabricated part matching, or a mixture of both. This repo aims at making a blend of both, and using creative limitations to foster a system of game balance.

The fist project is designing the data structure containing the Robot, the constituent Parts, and movement types, as well as a description of how each part connects to the other - building a connection graph.

Second project is designing weapon systems, such as pulse lasers, automatic cannons, plasma bomb cannons, missile launchers, and the like, branching into weapon groups, fire modes, magazine capacity, and heat generation, which is the primary limitation of how much firepower you can bring to bear. Also includes the implementation of variable accuracy/random dispersion of fire, as well as fire on the move penalties.

Third project will aim at making movement work using the following types: Hover, Mech Leg and track, fire on the move accuracy penalty, etc. Later on, other movement types might be added.
